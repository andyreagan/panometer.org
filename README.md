panometer.org
=============

this is the code running the site.
it's deployed using django and uwsgi, on a linode server.
for deployment details, see [@andyreagan's blog post](http://andyreagan.github.io/2014/09/30/django-on-linode-my-deployment-strategy/).

note: there is a lot of js, css, and html floating around from hedonometer.org, since it was just forked over.
decided to keep it for now, since we'll be forking some visualizations over too.
